* Background 

As a student, I learned to take [[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/phd-thesis/html/root-thesis.html][notes in Braille]] while in class and
while learning from audio books.   When reviewing the material, reading
the notes was far more efficient than re-listening to the original
recordings; however at the time, I had no means to easily jump to the
original content when perusing my notes.

Fast-forward to the age of online computing, a complete audio desktop
in the form of Emacspeak, a wealth of online resources in the form of
E-Books, Audio Books, Podcasts and Blogs, all backed by Universal
Search and accessible from a consistent environment. So I've been
asking myself what /note-taking/ in this environment should look like.
This article summarizes the present state of what I use at present.

* Use Case Requirements 
  1. All of the following should work equally well for locally stored
     material, e.g., downloaded E-Books from [[https://www.bookshare.org/cms/][Bookshare.org]]  or Project
     Gutenberg, as well as material hosted on the Internet in the form of
     Blogs and Podcasts.
  2. Create named bookmarks in E-Books (EPub, Daisy).
  3. Create  AMarks —bookmarks  that point to positions in an audio files.
  4. Above should be possible independent of whether the learning
     material is available locally, or accessed via the Internet.
  5. Enable the creation of hyperlinks to such bookmarks.
  6. Enable the easy creation of notes — organized by topic — while
    reading E-Books  or listening to  audio material.
  7. Enable the embedding of hyperlinks to the bookmarks mentioned
     earlier within these notes.
  8. Final experience: creation of notes should require minimal
     effort; when reading the notes, it should be  easy to open the
     relevant portion of the content that underlies the notes.

* User Experience 

** Create And Browse Bookmarks In E-Books 


  1. You can open Project Gutenberg EPubs via the Emacspeak Bookshelf
     ---   see
     [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002depub.html][Emacspeak Epub]].
  2. You can download and open Bookshare books using module
    [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002dbookshare.html][Emacspeak Bookshare]].
  3. Both of those modules open books using Emacs' built-in EWW browser.
  4. Module
     [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002deww.html][Emacspeak
     eww]] implements /eww-marks/, a bookmarking facility that manages
     bookmarks in EPub and Daisy books.

With a book open, you can:

  1. Create named bookmarks,
  2. Browse all saved bookmarks in your library,
  3. And open a given bookmark to continue reading.
  4. Bookmarks can also be stored as /org-mode links/ for later
     insertion  in an /org-mode/ file,  this means these hyperlinks
     integrate into notes taken in /org-mode/ without any additional work.

See [[https://orgmode.org/org.html][Org Mode Manual]], [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002dbookmark.html][Emacspeak Bookmarks]], [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002dbookshare.html][Emacspeak Bookshare]], and
[[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002depub.html][Emacspeak EPub]] for relevant sections of the user manual.

** Create And Browse AMarks In Audio Books 

  1. AMarks are Emacspeak's audio equivalent of traditional bookmarks.
  2. An AMark encapsulates the location of the audio content,  a
     time-offset, and a bookmark name.
  3. AMarks once created can be navigated to when playing that content
     via module [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002dm_002dplayer.html][Emacspeak MPlayer]] which provides a rich but seamless
     interface — here, /seamless/
     means you can play media content without switching from any
     on-going task, and in the context of this article, that means you
     can continue taking notes without explicitly switching context to
     the media-player.
  4. Emacspeak provides an AMarks Browser that lets you browse and
     play any AMark in your library.
  5. Finally, AMarks like bookmarks can be stored as org-mode links
     for later insertion into an org-mode file.

See [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/emacspeak_002damark.html][Emacspeak Amarks]] for the user manual.
** Create  Bookmarks   On Web Pages 

See module ~org-capture~ for inspiration.

**  Create Audio Bookmarks In Podcasts 

  1. Module ~emacspeak-m-player~ is used to play Podcasts and other
    forms of online audio-content, e.g., talks published on Youtube.
  2. This module can   store org-mode links to such content; storing
     such a link captures the current time offset into the content
     being played.
  3. These  stored links can then be inserted into an org-mode file;
     opening those links using org-mode hyperlinking facilities lets
     you resume playback at the marked position.

**  Create On-Line Notes Using Org-Mode


1. See the [[https://orgmode.org/org.html][Org Manual]] for details on taking notes in org-mode.   
2. Insert Hyperlinks To E-Books And Audio In Org-Mode by first storing
   the link as described earlier.
3. Review Notes, Follow Hyperlinks To Review Original Material  by
   opening the notes file in /org-mode/.



* Conclusion: Looking Back, Looking Forward 

  1. This describes a flexible workflow that is built out of multiple
    small components.
  2. Illustrating various   workflows as above outlines the space
    of possible solutions.
  3. Keeping the notes in /org-mode/ ensures that the notes are
     long-lived, since /org-mode/ files are essentially plain-text
     with an easy to parse syntax for parsing the underlying structure
     if needed to implement future extensions.
