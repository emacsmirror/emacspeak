* Introduction

  1. Emacspeak, started in September 1994, was released as Open
   Source in [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak//web/releases/release-3.0.html][April 1995]].
  2. [[https://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/turning-twenty.html][Emacspeak At Twenty]]  was published in September 2014 to trace the
     evolution of the project.
  3. Now, this article gives a birds-eye overview of the last 10 years
     by following the logical structure of the Turning-Twenty paper.
  4. In the process, we identify the dreams that have come to pass as
     well as the expectations that have failed to  materialize because
     of developments in the larger  Internet eco-system we live in.
  5. But never fear, though some of the above might be superficially
     disappointing, they likely herald the nature of bigger and better
     things to come.
  6. As a proof-point, in 1994, I could not have imagined the impact
     that the world of Internet-centric computing and the accompanying
     information revolution has had on the state of information
     access.

** How To Read This Document

  1. I recommend reading the /Turning Twenty/ paper to get a full overview.
  2. Then, read this paper a section at a time, while refering back to
     the parallel section in the /Turning Twenty/ paper.
  3. Make sure to skim or deep-dive into the references in both papers.
  

*  Using UNIX With Speech Output —  2024

  1. In 2024, Unix equates mostly to various Linux distros, and from
    the Emacspeak perspective, they are all made /mostly/ equal.
  2. Variations do exist and  running bleeding-edge distros can come
     with issues, e.g., unstable versions of the underlying audio framework.
  3. Yes, 30 years and counting, Linux Audio is still a work in
     progress though I hope Pipewire will be the last of these tidal shifts.
  4. Linux is moving to Wayland from X and expect that transition to
     be choppy.
  5. As with other platforms, /native apps/ are mostly gone bar the
     shouting; in that context, where the majority of users use most
     things through a /mainstream/ Web browser, Emacspeak users access
     /everything/ through Emacs.
  6. The above when things are done right is hugely empowering and
     enabling; when done badly, it's hugely disabling --- see later
     sections of this paper on  the continuing evolution of the Web.
     
* Key Enabler — Emacs And Lisp Advice

  1. Advice in Emacs is rock-solid.
  2. There is a newer /nadvice/ that is part of Emacs; Emacspeak does
     not use it.
  3. There are no plans to migrate to nadvice since that is a lot of
     busy work in my view and difficult to test any such migration.
  4. The classic /advice/ package may be removed from Emacs at some
     point in the future, but never fear; it'll be bundled with
     Emacspeak. This is a feature of Free Software and is a great
     example of what /Freedom/ means.
     
* Key Component —  Text To Speech (TTS)

  1. Speech output --- especially unencumbered text-to-speech is just
    as much a challenge as it was 30 years ago.
  2. Things appear to be coming full circle, Emacspeak started with
     the hardware Dectalk; now, the Software Dectalk is increasingly
     becoming the primary choice on Linux.
  3. Viavoice Outloud from Voxin is still supported (since 1999) but
     you can no longer buy new licenses; if you have a licence, it'll
     continue to work.
  4. The  Vocalizer voices that Voxin now sells /do not/ work with Emacspeak.
  5. The  other choice on Linux is ESpeak which will hopefully
     continue to be free -- albeit of much lower quality.
  6. The future as ever is unpredictable and new voices may well show
     up --- especially those powered by on-device LLMs as that
     technology progresses.
  7. On non-free platforms, there is usable TTS on the Mac, now
     supported by the new SwiftMac server for Emacspeak.
