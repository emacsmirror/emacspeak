cost of Ownership makes priceless software Universally affordable!

Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) --- http://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak
announces immediate world-wide availability of [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/releases/download/57.0/emacspeak-57.0.tar.bz2][Emacspeak 58.0]]
(ErgoDog) ü¶Æ --- a non-LLM powered audio desktop that leverages
today's evolving Data, Social and Assistant-Oriented Internet cloud to
enable working efficiently and effectively from anywhere!

* Investors Note:

With several prominent tweeters (and mythical elephants) expanding
coverage of _#emacspeak_, NASDOG: ESPK has now been consistently
trading over the social net at levels close to that once attained by
DogCom high-fliers‚Äîand is trading at levels close to that achieved by
once better known stocks in the tech sector.

* What Is It?

Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides complete
eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating environments. By
seamlessly blending live access to all aspects of the Internet such as
ubiquitous assistance, Web-surfing, blogging, remote software
development, streaming media, social computing and electronic
messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak enables spoken access to
local and remote information with a consistent and well-integrated
user interface. A rich suite of task-oriented tools provides efficient
speech-enabled access to the evolving assistant-oriented social
Internet cloud.

* Major Enhancements:



1. Updated Keybindings  ‚å®
2. Smart Buffer Selection ‚õè
3. Audio Volume Adjust üîà
4. Speech-Rate AdjustüöÑ
5. Twitter Support Removed X marks the spot.
6. BBC Sounds URL Template  üìª
7. [[https://garfnet.org.uk/cms/2023/10/29/latest-bbc-hls-radio-streams/][BBC
   HLS Streams]]  using MPV üìª
8. ZOxide Integration ‚è† ‚è°
9. emacspeak-pipewire «Å


      ‚Äî And a lot more than will fit this margin. ‚Ä¶ üóû
  
Note: This version *requires* emacs-29.1 or later. 

* Establishing Liberty, Equality And Freedom:

  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure‚Äîa documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
and the underlying GIT versioning software used to develop and distribute the system.

Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   free of cost 
as ever‚Äîit is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.

At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
features that eventually show up in luser environments.

On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a system from
the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the unusual
candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
press releases.

* Independent Test Results:


Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; ‚ÄúIt is the user --- and not the
computer-- that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!‚Äù.

** Note from Aster,Bubbles and Tilden:

UnDoctored Videos Inc. is looking for volunteers to star in a
video demonstrating such complete user failure.

Emacspeak can be downloaded from GitHub --- see
